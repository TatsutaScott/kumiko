# Studies in Pattern: Kumiko 
Just in the way that painters practice their craft, painting fruit on a table, as digital artists, there must be a similar method to practice our craft. 
This repository is a collection of my practice, working with patterns, specifically the complex patterns of traditional Japanese Kumiko. 

## Kumiko 
Kumiko is the traditional Japanese art of assembling complex woodworking without the use of nails. Tracing all the way back to the Asuka period, Kumiko was developed as an artform used to decorate shoji paper screens.
